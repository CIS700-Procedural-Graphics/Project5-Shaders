# Project 5: Shaders

Shaders Implemented: 

- Pointillism
    - Computed a noise value based on position and drew a black pixel if the noise was above a certain threshold. 
- Hatching
    - Used a sine function to create a hatching texture. Used a noise function to add in some speckles as well.
- Monochromatic Shading
    - I shaded the geometry similarly to the toon shader, but I mapped values to a monochromatic pallate.   
- Geometric Shading
    - I used multioctave noise to offset the UV coordinates in an interesting way. The result was not what I expected, but it looks pretty cool.
- Screen Print Shader
    - Used a noise function that has a lot of repeated patterns to create a texture that looks like a screen print.
